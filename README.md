## Overview

The Marriage Allowance DES Stub is a service to support stateless sandbox testing in the
Developer Sandbox (External Test) environment.

It exposes:
* a test support API on the API Platform that allows third party software developers
to prime test data in order to test different scenarios

* DES endpoints related to fetching marriage allowance data

The test support endpoints exposed to the API Platform are documented in the
[OAS definition](https://github.com/hmrc/marriage-allowance-des-stub/blob/master/resources/public/api/conf/1.0/application.yaml)

Internal users within HMRC can search Confluence for "Testing APIS with external parties" for further information.

## What uses this service?
API microservices that need to call DES to fetch marriage allowance data which are
deployed to the External Test environment should be configured to connect
to this stub instead of a real DES.

API microservices which this stubs behaviour for are currently:
* Marriage Allowance
