## Overview

The Marriage Allowance DES Stub is a service to support stateless sandbox testing in the
External Test environment.

It exposes:
* a test support API on the API Platform that allows third party software developers
to prime test data in order to test different scenarios

* DES endpoints related to fetching marriage allowance data

The test support endpoints exposed to the API Platform are documented in the
[RAML definition](https://github.com/hmrc/marriage-allowance-des-stub/blob/master/resources/public/api/conf/1.0/application.raml)

## What uses this service?
API microservices that need to call DES to fetch marriage allowance data which are
deployed to the External Test environment should be configured to connect
to this stub instead of a real DES.

API microservices which this stubs behaviour for are currently:
* [Marriage Allowance](https://github.tools.tax.service.gov.uk/HMRC/marriage-allowance)


## Running the tests
```
./run_all_test.sh
```

## Running the service locally

To run the service locally on port `9687`:
```
./run_local.sh
```

Alternatively, use Service Manager to start `MARRIAGE_ALLOWANCE_DES_STUB`
